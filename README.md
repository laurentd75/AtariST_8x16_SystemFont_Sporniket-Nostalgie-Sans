# Sporniket Nostalgie Sans

*Sporniket Nostalgie Sans* is an opentype font project that is inspired by the Atari ST system 8×16 font.

The goal is that at a certain size, the rasterization of the glyphes will look like the aformentioned font. However,
it will not always be perfect, so that it looks more coherent or nice to my taste.

Especially :
* The ampersand `&` glyph is a condensed `Et`.
* As the name imply, the font is a 'sans serif' font, so any serif has been removed, and so uppercase `I` is a simple
vertical stick.
* The vertical metrics has been choosen so that glyph with diacritic like `É` are not deformed like on the original font.
