# Sporniket Nostalgie Sans v1

*Sporniket Nostalgie Sans* is an opentype font project that is inspired by the Atari ST system 8×16 font.

The goal is that at a certain size, the rasterization of the glyphes will look like the aformentioned font. However,
it will not always be perfect, so that it looks more coherent or nice to my taste.

Especially :
* The ampersand `&` glyph is a condensed `Et`.
* As the name imply, the font is a 'sans serif' font, so any serif has been removed, and so uppercase `I` is a simple
vertical stick.
* The vertical metrics has been choosen so that glyph with diacritic like `É` are not deformed like on the original font.

# Sporniket Nostalgie v2

*Sporniket Nostalgie v2* is a collection of fonts inspired by the Atari ST system : its system fonts ('high resolution' 8×16, 'low resolution' 8×8, 'tiny' 6×6), mouse pointers (standard, bee, ...) and default icons (drive icons, file and folders icons).

## v2 Roadmap

The collection will provide the following fonts, in this order of making :
* a 'console' variant
* a 'small console' variant
* a 'tiny console' variant
* a 'sans-serif' variant
* a 'serif' variant
* an 'icon' variant

## Sporniket Nostalgie v2 — console variants

A set of fixed width fonts inspired by the 8×16 ('console'), 8×8 ('small console') and 6×6 ('tiny console') system fonts. The motto of these fonts : «faithful on screen, beautiful on paper». As a matter of fact, the faithfulness will be limited to the ASCII-127 range, because I don't want to see diacritics with deformed glyphes (and because I would like to define those glyphes as a combination of a base glyph and an accent).

### Roadmap
